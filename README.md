## Project Services
### Booking Appointments
The app facilitates seamless scheduling and management of medical appointments. Users can book, and cancel appointments with their account through an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The appointment module integrates with the backend to ensure real-time updates.

### Brain Tumor Diagnosis
The app incorporates advanced machine learning algorithms for the diagnosis of brain tumors. By analyzing medical images, the app assists patients in identifying and diagnosing brain tumors with high accuracy. This feature leverages state-of-the-art techniques in medical image analysis to provide reliable and timely diagnoses.

## Project Features
### Kotlin
Kotlin is a modern, statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can also be compiled to JavaScript or native code. It is fully interoperable with Java, making it a popular choice for Android development due to its expressive syntax and enhanced safety features.

### Jetpack Compose
Jetpack Compose is a modern UI toolkit for Android that simplifies UI development by using a declarative approach. It allows developers to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces with less code, using Kotlin to describe the UI components and their interactions.

### MVVM with Clean Architecture
Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a design pattern that separates the development of the graphical user interface from the development of the business logic or back-end logic. Clean Architecture provides a way to organize your code so that it's easier to maintain and test by separating concerns and making the code more modular.

### Coroutines
Coroutines are a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously. They help manage background tasks, such as network calls or disk operations, efficiently and without blocking the main thread.

### Paging
The Paging library makes it easier to load data gradually and gracefully in your app's UI. It allows you to load pages of data from a larger dataset, reducing the amount of memory required and providing a smoother user experience.

### Navigation Components
Navigation Components help you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and navigation drawers. It simplifies handling fragment transactions, managing back stack, and handling deep links.

### Hilt for Dependency Injection
Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate code required for setting up dependency injection in your app. It provides a standardized way to incorporate Dagger, a powerful dependency injection framework, into your Android project.

### Retrofit
Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java, developed by Square. It makes it easy to consume RESTful web services by mapping HTTP API into Java interfaces.

### OkHttp
OkHttp is an efficient HTTP and HTTP/2 client for Android and Java applications. It supports features like connection pooling, GZIP compression, and response caching to minimize network usage and improve performance.

### DataStore Preferences
DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. It's a more modern and efficient alternative to SharedPreferences for saving small amounts of data.

### Coil
Coil is an image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines. It is designed to be fast, lightweight, and easy to use, making it a great choice for loading and displaying images in your app.
